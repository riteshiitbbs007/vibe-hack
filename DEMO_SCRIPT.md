## üé¨ Demo Flow

### **Scene 1: Introduction (1 minute)**

> "Today I'll show you how Cursor, combined with Figma MCP and Playwright, can automatically generate Lightning Design System 2 compliant components and verify their visual accuracy."

**Show:** 
- Clean Cursor workspace
- Open demo project at `localhost:3000`
- Point out the SLDS2 branding and focus

### **Scene 2: Figma Design System Integration (3 minutes)**

> "Let's start with a Figma design. I have a SLDS2 Badge Success component designed according to Lightning Design System 2 specifications."

**Actions:**
1. **Open Figma** (or use mock design reference)
2. **Highlight SLDS2 Features:**
   - Styling hooks usage
   - Semantic structure  
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Color tokens and spacing

> "Now, let's use Cursor with Figma MCP to generate this component automatically."

**In Cursor:**
3. **Generate Component:**
   - Click "üéØ SLDS2 Badge Success" button
   - Show the generation process
   - Explain the SLDS2 compliance features being generated

### **Scene 3: SLDS2 Code Generation (3 minutes)**

> "Notice how the generated component follows SLDS2 architecture principles."

**Show Generated Code:**
4. **Switch to Code Tab** in the demo
5. **Highlight Key SLDS2 Features:**
   ```typescript
   // Point out these features:
   - CSS custom properties (styling hooks)
   - Semantic HTML structure (span, not div)
   - ARIA attributes for accessibility
   - Global design tokens integration
   - Component-level styling hooks
   ```

6. **Explain Benefits:**
   - Framework-agnostic design
   - Runtime theming capability
   - Accessibility built-in
   - Future-proof architecture

### **Scene 4: Live Component Preview (2 minutes)**

> "Let's see the component in action with SLDS2's flexible theming system."

**Actions:**
7. **Switch back to Preview tab**
8. **Show Live Component:**
   - Point out SLDS2 compliance badges
   - Demonstrate the styling hooks in action
   - Show how it matches the Figma design

> "But how do we ensure this component always matches our Figma design? That's where Playwright visual regression testing comes in."

### **Scene 5: Playwright Visual Testing (4 minutes)**

> "Now let's run automated visual tests to verify our component matches the Figma design pixel-perfectly."

**Actions:**
9. **Run Visual Tests** (in Cursor terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run test:figma
   ```

10. **Explain the Testing Process:**
    - Component isolation testing
    - Styling hooks validation
    - Cross-context rendering
    - Pixel-perfect comparison

11. **Show Test Results:**
    - Display passing tests (4/4 ‚úÖ)
    - Explain what each test validates
    - Show test execution time

12. **Demonstrate Test Report:**
    ```bash
    npx playwright show-report playwright-report-figma
    ```
    - Show detailed visual comparisons
    - Point out baseline vs actual screenshots
    - Highlight the precision (0.1% threshold)

### **Scene 6: Advanced SLDS2 Features (2 minutes)**

> "Let's demonstrate SLDS2's most powerful feature: runtime styling hooks."

**Actions:**
13. **Show Styling Hooks in Action:**
    - Open browser developer tools
    - Modify CSS custom properties live:
      ```css
      --slds-c-badge-color-background: #1976d2
      --slds-c-badge-text-color: #ffffff
      ```
    - Show instant theme changes

14. **Explain Enterprise Benefits:**
    - Brand customization without code changes
    - Dark mode support
    - Agentic experience readiness
    - Multi-tenant theming
