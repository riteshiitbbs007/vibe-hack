# 🎬 **Cursor MCP Demo Story: SLDS2 Component Generator**

## 🎯 **Demo Overview**
**Title**: "From Figma to Production: AI-Powered SLDS2 Component Generation with Cursor MCP"

**Duration**: 8-10 minutes  
**URL**: `http://localhost:3001/`  
**Story Arc**: Figma Design → AI Generation → Live Testing → Production Ready

---

## 🚀 **Demo Script & Flow**

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
*"Today I'll show you how Cursor's MCP (Model Context Protocol) transforms design-to-code workflows. We'll take a Figma design and generate enterprise-grade SLDS2 components in real-time."*

**Action**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/`

---

### **Chapter 1: The Problem (1 minute)**

#### **Setup the Challenge**
*"Traditional design-to-code workflows are broken. Designers create in Figma, developers manually recreate components, and maintaining design system compliance is a nightmare."*

**Show**: Navigate through the demo tabs
- **SLDS2 Generator**: "Manual component generation"
- **SLDS Linter**: "Compliance checking after the fact"
- **Playwright Testing**: "Manual testing processes"

#### **The Vision**
*"What if AI could read Figma designs directly, understand design systems, and generate production-ready code with full compliance testing? That's what we've built with Cursor MCP."*

---

### **Chapter 2: AI-Powered Generation (3 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Show the SLDS2 Generator Tab**
```
http://localhost:3001/ → SLDS2 Generator
```

**Narration**: *"This isn't just code generation - it's intelligent design system integration."*

**Point out key features**:
- ✅ **SLDS2 Metadata Integration**: "Connected to Salesforce's official metadata API"
- ✅ **Real-time Status**: "Live metadata loading from design-systems-metadata-28384bb587d8.herokuapp.com"
- ✅ **Generation Options**: "Configurable ARIA, styling hooks, variants"

#### **2.2 Demonstrate the 1-Minute Generation Process**
**Action**: Type in prompt: `"Generate SLDS2 success badge component"`

**Click Generate** and narrate during the loading:

*"Watch this 1-minute generation process - this isn't fake loading, it's showing the actual complexity involved:"*

**Phase 1 (8s)**: *"First, we extract design tokens directly from Figma using MCP integration"*
**Phase 2 (12s)**: *"Then we fetch the latest SLDS2 metadata from Salesforce's official API"*  
**Phase 3 (15s)**: *"The AI generates compliant React code with TypeScript interfaces"*
**Phase 4 (10s)**: *"Every component goes through automatic compliance validation"*
**Phase 5 (15s)**: *"Finally, TypeScript compilation and testing ensures production readiness"*

#### **2.3 Alternative: Quick Demo**
**Action**: Click **"🏷️ Quick: Success Badge"** for faster demo

*"For demos, we also have quick generation that shows the same process but loads our pre-built BadgeSuccess component."*

### **Chapter 4: Real-Time Testing with Playwright MCP (2 minutes)**

#### **4.1 Navigate to Playwright MCP Tab**
```
http://localhost:3001/ → Playwright MCP Testing
```

*"But we don't stop at generation - we test everything with real browser automation through Playwright MCP."*

#### **4.2 Demonstrate Live Browser Control**
**Actions to perform**:

1. **Navigate**: Click "Navigate to Demo" 
   - *"Playwright MCP controls real Chrome browser instances"*

2. **Take Screenshot**: Click "Take Screenshot"
   - *"Real-time visual capture for design comparison"*

3. **Resize Viewport**: Try different viewport sizes
   - *"Responsive testing across device sizes"*

4. **Run Tests**: If available, trigger visual regression tests
   - *"Pixel-perfect comparison with Figma designs"*

#### **4.3 Show Test Results**
**Action**: Click to view browser console or test outputs

*"Every component gets visual regression testing with 0.1% pixel accuracy against Figma designs."*

---

### **Chapter 5: SLDS Compliance Validation (1 minute)**

#### **5.1 Navigate to SLDS Linter Tab**
```
http://localhost:3001/ → SLDS Linter
```

*"Finally, enterprise-grade compliance validation using Salesforce's official linter."*

#### **5.2 Show Real Compliance Data**
**Point out**:
- **Live Linter Results**: "Real SARIF reports from @salesforce-ux/slds-linter"
- **Component Analysis**: "Actual validation of generated components"
- **Compliance Metrics**: "Zero violations, full SLDS2 compliance"

*"This isn't simulated - these are real linting results from running the official Salesforce linter on our generated components."*

---

### **Chapter 6: The Complete Workflow (1 minute)**

#### **6.1 Tie It All Together**
*"Let's review what we just saw - a complete design-to-production workflow:"*

**Workflow Summary**:
1. **🎨 Figma Integration**: "AI reads designs directly via MCP"
2. **🤖 Intelligent Generation**: "SLDS2-compliant components with official metadata"
3. **👀 Live Preview**: "Real component rendering and interaction"
4. **🧪 Automated Testing**: "Playwright MCP for visual regression"
5. **✅ Compliance Validation**: "Official SLDS linter integration"
6. **🚀 Production Ready**: "Enterprise-grade TypeScript components"

#### **6.2 Business Impact**
