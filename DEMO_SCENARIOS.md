## 🔄 **Scenario 2: Mid-Demo Recovery**
*Something goes wrong during the demo*

### **Common Issues & Recovery:**

#### **Issue: Component doesn't render**
**Recovery Actions:**
```bash
# Quick restart
npm run dev
# Refresh browser
# Click component button again
```
**Talking Points:**
> "Let me restart the development server quickly - this shows how fast the development cycle is."

#### **Issue: Tests fail**
**Recovery Actions:**
```bash
npm run test:figma:update
npm run test:figma
```
**Talking Points:**
> "I'll update the test baselines - this is exactly what you'd do when intentionally updating designs."

#### **Issue: Styling hooks don't respond**
**Recovery Actions:**
- Try different CSS properties
- Use Firefox dev tools instead
- Show the CSS file directly
**Talking Points:**
> "Let me show you the styling hooks in the CSS file instead - same concept, different view."
