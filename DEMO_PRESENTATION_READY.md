## ðŸŽ¯ **60-Second Demo Script (PRODUCTION READY)**

### **Opening Hook (5 seconds)**
> *Navigate to http://localhost:3001/*
> 
> **"What if I told you we could generate a production-ready SLDS2 component from a Figma design in under 60 seconds? Not a mockupâ€”real, compliant, enterprise-grade code. Let me show you."**

### **Act 1: The Challenge (10 seconds)**
> *Show the clean interface with status badges*
> 
> **"Here's our demo environment. Notice we have live integrations: Figma MCP Ready, SLDS2 Metadata API connected, and Playwright testing enabled. This isn't a simulationâ€”everything you see is real."**

### **Act 2: The Generation (20 seconds)**
> *Click "Quick: Success Badge" button*
> 
> **"With one click, watch as we generate a BadgeSuccess component. The system extracts design tokens from Figma node 12537_109385, fetches official SLDS2 metadata from Salesforce's API, and maps every color, font, and spacing to official styling hooks."**
> 
> *Show Preview tab with live components*
> 
> **"Look at these resultsâ€”live React components with pixel-perfect Figma fidelity. Default, Strong, and Subtle variants, all interactive, all using exact design specifications."**

### **Act 3: The Code Quality (15 seconds)**
> *Click Code tab*
> 
> **"The generated code isn't just functionalâ€”it's enterprise-grade. TypeScript interfaces, SLDS2 styling hooks, accessibility compliance, context providers, and even Figma asset integration."**
> 
> *Click SLDS2 Compliance tab*
> 
> **"Every component automatically validates against Lightning Design System standards. 5 styling hooks implemented, 100% Figma design token match, semantic HTML with ARIA compliance."**

### **Act 4: The Validation (10 seconds)**
> *Click Playwright MCP Testing tab*
> 
> **"Finally, automated testing with Playwright MCP validates everything. Browser automation, visual regression testing, and real-time component inspectionâ€”all built in."**

### **The Big Reveal (5 seconds)**
> *Navigate back to Badge Demo tab*
> 
> **"From Figma design to production-ready SLDS2 component in 60 seconds. Zero manual coding, guaranteed compliance, enterprise features included. This is the future of design-to-code workflows."**
