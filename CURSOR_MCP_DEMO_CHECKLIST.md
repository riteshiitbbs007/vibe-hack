## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **If Generation Seems Slow**
- Use **"üè∑Ô∏è Quick: Success Badge"** for time-constrained demos
- Explain that real-world complexity justifies the time
- Use loading time for narration and explanation

### **If Components Don't Render**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Fall back to code view and compliance tabs

### **If Playwright MCP Issues**
- Use the screenshots and explanations
- Focus on the test results and validation
- Emphasize the concept over live execution
